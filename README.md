# read in data, check content and dimensions (analogous for train and test)
Find out about dimensions and content of the individual datasets in order 
  to properly fit them together: 
 
  Content: 
  - features: contains column names for X_train dataset
  - X_train: contains the actual data
  - y_train: labels the activity on which data has been collected
  - subject_train: labels the individual that performed an activity

  Dimensions: 
  I do not consider the datasets found in the data folder "Inertial Signs", 
  since they are raw data which are not used in the later steps (for the sake 
  of completeness, the "inertial" data sets have dimensions 7352 x 128 each).
